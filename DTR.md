Project: Quantified Self

Group Member Names: Jalena Taylor, Matt Weiss

Project Expectations: Complete project. Maintain a good documentation process throughout. (Don't write the README the night before).

What does each group member hope to get out of this project? Finish with a better understanding of our ORM of choice and promises. Get comfortable with Jest testing.

Team strengths: Matt feels like he has a strong enough base in JS, ORMs and deployment. Jalena feels good about sequelize and express and everything JS except promises.

How to overcome obstacles: 30 minute timebox when struggling. Use the rest of the class as well as just each other as resources.

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually?): Initial setup Day 1 will include spinning up app, deploying, and implementing CI. We both have open availability over the 4 day weekend.

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?): We're going to concentrate on communicating via PR threads on github. Any Slack conversations that result in progress will also be moved to GitHub.

Abilities Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement): Matt wants to work on commenting code when doing more complex operations. Jalena would like to get more comfortable with accessing and manipulating promises and returns.

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?): 

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests): Don't merge own PRs, code conversation takes place in github rather than slack. Concentrate on proper code reviews before merges.

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback: Specific, Actionable, Kind

Agenda to discuss project launch:
 - Create Project board
 - Spin up express app
 - Heroku app created
 - Configure TravisCI and make first PR/deployment
